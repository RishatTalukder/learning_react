# What's Better Than Doing Something Once? Doing It 6 Times!

This is my `6th` attempt at learning react Fully. I have tried to learn It 5 times before but never finished it. I'm downloaded a `Course` from `Udemy` in 2023 and I loved the way `john Smilga` teaches. I looked for the course in `udemy` but couldn't find it but he has other great courses. 

Also he has a youtube channel `Coding Addict` where he teaches `React` and other web technologies. 

I also have a youtube channel but I'm Make `Python` tutorials in `Bangla`. Soon i'll start a video series on `React` in `Bangla`. 

So, this is my 6th attempt at learning `React` so that I can teach it to others.

Repository: [GitHub](https://github.com/RishatTalukder/learning_react)

Structure of this repository is like this:

```bash

PART_1
    - Some Folders
    - readme.md
PART_2
    - Some Folders
    - readme.md
 .....

```

Every part will have a `readme.md` file where I'll write the whole documentation of that part like an article. And also the structure of the folders and files in that part.

#### Happy Reacting bois!
